So I cleaned my ccache (this is the \"without cheating\" from the title) and started a build from my notebook with distccd running on the other machines.So all in all I had:one Lenovo W520 notebook (4 core i7-2720QM with 16GB RAM)one Sun Ultra 24 workstation (4 core Q9650 with 8GB RAM)one IBM x3800 (8 core Xeon MP 3.16Mhz with 8GB RAM)and the development build1) chugged in after 32 Minutes. Rebuilding from ccache took ~8 minutes on that machine, so \"pure compile time\" was ~25 Minutes. Of course, starting the build on one of the other machines would likely have been a bit faster still as:the Sun Ultra is about twice as fast alone as the notebook alone (full build in &lt;1 hour)the notebook did not run on a software RAID-0 (like the others would)the notebook did not mount the build platform with noatime, which would be good for a few additional minutes of saved timeSo: When doing a lot of work on Libreoffice, RAID-0 and noatime (together with distcc and ccache) are to be considered. However, If you are new the code, you probably only want to care about:ccache--disable-mozilla--disable-binfilterall the other stuff is only getting interesting once you are doing very regular work on Libreoffice. And an since it is getting winter again on the northern hemisphere: An IBM x3800 is a nice way to heat your apartment, if it was not for the noise and the electricity bills.1) 2 jobs per core and:&nbsp;&nbsp;./autogen.sh &lt;br /&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;--disable-mozilla --disable-binfilter --disable-zenity &lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;--with-junit=${HOME}/.jenkins/junit-4.9b2.jar --with-external-tar=readlink -f ${WORKSPACE}/../../tarfiles/workspace &lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;--without-help --without-myspell-dicts &lt;br /&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;--with-system-libs &lt;br /&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;--without-system-libvisio --without-system-libcmis --without-system-jars --without-system-graphite --without-system-lpsolve --without-system-libexttextcat --without-system-poppler --enable-librsvg=no &lt;br /&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;--with-num-cpus=35 --with-max-jobs=35\nThis was originally published at 2011-10-24 17:13:00/2011-10-24 15:13:39 on livejournal.\n","id":"https://bjoernmichaelsen.github.io/blog/building-libreoffice-in-half-an-hour-on-ubuntu-oneiric-without-cheating/","title":"Building Libreoffice in half an hour on Ubuntu Oneiric (without cheating)"},"https://bjoernmichaelsen.github.io/blog/debugging-junit-subsequenttests-made-easy/":{"body":"debugging (Junit) subsequenttests made easy!\nThe Junit-based subsequenttests for LibreOffice have up to now been quite annoying to debug.

After talking about the dry topic of repositories,  this post is a just a short post about the output of the new build  system. It tries to keep the output calm and clean by default.

The __.oO and Xx.__  ASCII art represent my best attempt at symbolizing a building/cleaning  target. If you have a better idea, give me a note. Please note that the  colored output will also help when using a verbose build as it will  stick out between all the other output and allows easier orientation in  the output. The gb_TITLES=T enables that the progress is also shown in the terminal title. Screenshots are not very good at conveying that, unfortunately.    The two terminal windows on the right show some of the verbose error messages that the gbuild  system issues when it deems something wrong. Please note that these  errors are reported early (before starting to really build anything) and  not late (when trying to actually compile/link something that does not  exist).    Here are a few conditions, that gbuild will try to detect and complain about:    initial makefile outside of the source repositoriesno call to gb_Helper_register_repository in the Repository.mkadding an executable/library to an invalid group in gb_Helper_register_* (The error message will report the valid groups.)corrupted module stacksadding a object to a library which has no C/C++ source file in any of the repositoriesgenerating a component file which has no source file in any of the repositoriesgenerating resource for which there is no source file in any of the repositorieslinking against a library that was not registered in Repository.mkdefining a library that was not registered in Repository.mkunknown platformThat is it for this post.

It is covering how to use the multi repository support of gbuild.        Welcome back to the&nbsp;little blog series about the new GNU make build system. After having covered the setup of a module in the gbuild system in the last post, this one will be about how repositories are setup with gbuild. A repository in gbuild is a directory where source files are found. While OpenOffice.org currently has every source file in one big repository, gbuild supports to have multiple repositories and will find a file in any of those.    Making repositories known to gbuild    gbuild needs to be told about the repositories it should look for source files. This is done with the variable gb_REPOS which contains a whitespace separated list of source directories. For backwards compatibility, if gb_REPOS is not set, it defaults to $(SOLARSRC) for now (we might get rid of that one day and set gb_REPOS in ./configure along with SOLARSRC).    Setting up a repository for gbuild    Three files need to be present in the root of a gbuild repository:    Repository.mkRepositoryFixes.mkand Module_*.mk    In Repository.mk  we define some things that need to be globally known for the build. The  first thing that needs to be globally set is a variable name for this repository, so that we can refer to it -- for example when defining include paths. This is done by a statement like this:    &nbsp;          $(eval $(call gb_Helper_register_repository,SRCDIR))        Because of this statement the OpenOffice.org source repository can be referenced as $(SRCDIR) when defining include paths. Other repositories should obviously use a different variable name for their directory.    In addition, we need to declare the naming scheme and the layer  that libraries and executables end up in the final product. With the statement:          $(eval $(call gb_Helper_register_libraries,OOOLIBS, [...] fwk [...] sw [...] ))        We register the libraries \"fwk\" and \"sw\" to be \"OOOLIBS\". What this  means exactly depends on the platform, but on Linux 64-Bit for example  it means that the libraries are named \"libfwklx.so\" and \"libswlx.so\" and  will end up in the OpenOffice.org layer of the product. This  information needs to be declared globally in the repository and can not be simply declared in the local files in the modules like framework/Library_fwk.mk  : When one does a partial build (only one module, e.g. sw) that  information is still needed, because the filenames of the linked-against  libraries need to be known. On OSX, additionally the exact location of  the linked-against library (and thus its layer) needs to be known at  linktime.    The second file RepositoryFixes.mk  is to fix for those cases where developers got too creative for their  own good and followed a naming scheme only mostly: naming it slightly  different on one platform, for example. When gbuild starts up, it parses the Repository.mk in each repository.&nbsp; Then it loads the platform defaults and assigns the names and layers according to it. After that the RepositoryFixes.mk file in each repository  gets parsed and can fix around \"special cases\". It should contain all  the hacks that work around things that break the usual systematics.    The final file is the Module_*.mk. In the case of the OpenOffice.org repository this is the Module_ooo.mk file. When everything is migrated to gbuild,  one will not build module-by-module, but with one make process. This  make process will finally, after parsing all other setup code, go into  each repository it find in gb_REPOS and include the one Module_*.mk file it finds there. After parsing those module files, the modules in each of those are added as dependencies to the all target -- they need to be built and it turn ensure all modules that are part of it to be built. Gbuild modules can include other modules (yes, you can build \"module trees\" of arbitrary depth). Module_ooo.mk is just a module that includes all migrated modules.    Ok, enough already of this dry and rather boring topic. The next post will be about eyecandy for developers.(This is a very raw mirror of the original blog post made to blogs.sun.com  on 23 Nov 2010.

It is covering gbuild commands and usage.    Welcome back to the&nbsp;little blog series about the new GNU make build system. After showing off some ANSI color eyecandy  for the new build system it is time to have a look at the new build  system and how to command it in the usual usecases (all commands assume  the shell to be in root directory of the module in question, if no  explicit cd command is given):    &nbsp;                            build.pl/dmake          GNU make build system          description                          build &amp;&amp; deliver          make -sr          builds the current module                          deliver -undeliver &amp;&amp; rm -rf $PLATFORM          make -sr clean          clears the module from the $OUTDIR (solver) and clears local build directories                          build --all &amp;&amp; deliver          build --all           &nbsp;                          cd instsetoo_native &amp;&amp; build --all          cd $SRC_ROOT &amp;&amp; make -sr          builds all                          cd instsetoo_native &amp;&amp; build --prepare --from sal          cd $SRC_ROOT &amp;&amp; make -sr clean          clears all modules and all local build directories                      Some things changed from the old build system. Here is an overview:    no local output tree    The GNU make build system does not use a \"local module output directory\". All modules use a $WORKDIR (by default a directory named \"workdir\" in the platform directory in the $OUTDIR/solver) for intermediate files. This makes the source tree read-only for the migrated modules.    cleaning up of modules    build --prepare will not clear the $WORKDIR of files by migrated modules. However, calling make -sr clean in the module or in the $SRC_ROOT will.    current directory when starting make    Other than build.pl, one can not call make in any subdirectory  to build the module. Either, one has to cd to the module root before  calling make, or one has to explicitly give the makefile in the module  root to the make command: cd sw/source/core &amp;&amp; make -srf  ../../Makefile.    changes in parallelization    The old build system used one dmake process per directory, while the new  one is hooked into build.pl as one make process per module for now. Big modules like sw only  use the parallelization by the second -P switch given to the build --all  command. As more and more modules get migrated the second -P switch in a  build --all -P4 -- -P4  command will get more important. In the end -- after getting rid of  build.pl -- only one make process will be used for the whole build and  the maximum number of jobs will be given to via the -j switch, thus eliminating the need for guesswork on how to distribute the parallelization over the two old systems.    &nbsp;    precompiled debug headers    On Windows support for precompiled headers is also available on debug  builds, resulting for example in a speedup of ~40% for an build of  module sw for debug builds.    &nbsp;    no seperation of build and deliver    The new build system does not separate the build and deliver steps  of a module. Since libraries are always linked against the solver/$OUTDIR  this means that in module framework, where the library fwk is linking  against the library fwi, the library fwi will be copied to the solver/$OUTDIR  before linking the library fwk. This lifts the artificial dependency  barriers introduced by modules, but also results in that building a  module always modifies the solver/$OUTDIR. It also avoids the confusion of building a module, but forgetting to deliver it.    no local module builds    One can not simply copy a module to \"anywhere\" and build it there.  The build system will notice this and will bail out. And even when it  would not bail out, it would ignore the copied module for anything but  the makefiles. It would still look for the files to build and to compile  in the directories given in the variable $gb_REPOS as described in the post about multiple repository support.    To provide a workaround for the rare usecase that one wants to  build only one module with some quick or risky changes without changing  the solver, there is a setuplocal target available in gbuild. For example to do experimental stuff on the tools module one would:          export gb_LOCALBUILDDIR=/tmp/myoootoolsexperiment      cd tools      make setuplocal # this  will create a copy of the tools module and the solver at  $gb_LOCALBUILDDIR and tune the build system to that location      cd /tmp/myoootoolsexperiment/srcdir/tools      # hack away      cd $SRC_ROOT/tools      make removelocal # clears $gb_LOCALBUILDDIR and allows work directly on the source        This is an extension to the gbuild system (because it relies on rsync, which the gbuild core itself should not do) and thus can be found in the extensions directory of the build system.    full dependencies    Migrated modules always have full dependencies thus changing one  header in a low level module will trigger a rebuild of all objects using  that header. On Windows that means all headers except compiler headers  and headers from platform, directx and Java SDK, on the other platforms  it means all headers.    Faster no-op builds    Checking that nothing (or almost nothing) needs to be rebuild is  faster. On a sample system (Notebook with Core2Duo, 2 GHz) on Windows XP  (anti virus software installed), rechecking that nothing needs to be  done for module sw takes 7 sec with a warm cache. On the same machine  build.pl/dmake took 210 sec with the same \"full\" header dependencies.(This is a very raw mirror of the original blog post made to blogs.sun.com  on 21 Dec 2010.

It is covering the memory usage of the new GNU make build  system when using full dependencies.        Since the first announcement  of plans to replace the old build.pl/dmake build system with a new  solution, one of the focus points was the correct handling of  dependencies. To handle this problem correctly, multiple approaches have  been tried and one was to have all dependencies in one process because recursive make is considered harmful. As the gnumake2 cws  is finally approaching the final status in the lifecycle of a feature  branch (being \"ready for QA\" until \"integrated\"), it is time to address  one of the main concerns reported by community members about it: memory  usage.    The very idea of having all information about an OpenOffice.org  build in one process -- including all dependencies -- might sound  obnoxious and  megalomaniac at first. But in general, memory got cheap in recent years  and it was the time to at least consider this option.    By now, we can say it was well worth it: gnumake2 is now capable of  building eight modules (framework, sfx2, svl, svtools, sw, toolkit,  tools, xmloff) in one process, and we have a solid base to approximate  the memory usage of a build that contains all dependencies in one  process.    First we have to find a reasonable metric of \"dependency-intensity\"  of a part of the build. Then we can try to relate that metric to the  memory usage measured on migrated modules to extrapolate to a full  build.    A simple metric is the number on #include-statements in hxx- and  cxx-files.

This  plot show no obvious systematic error in the assumption of the model:                &nbsp;      The last two data points are the predictions of the model for a full build with and without binfilter:      without binfilter: 170-190 MiB (pmap), 150-170 MiB (massif)with binfilter: 190-210 MiB (pmap), 170-180 MiB (massif)So it can be assumed that a full build with all dependencies  can be handled decently even by slower and smaller hardware as even  common ARM machines have enough RAM to handle this.      Finishing note: gnumake2 will be integrated soon, so if you are using  actively developing on the DEV300 codeline, it is advisable to check  out the basics of it.

And while I am not usually a guy caring much about traditions, LibreOffice and the Document Foundation is a just cause that I firmly believe in. So, to put my money where my mouth is, I just donated 220 Euro (or 5 Euro for each week I am on the project) to the Document Foundation. I dont know if that is much or little and honestly I dont care that much really.Quite a few people are donating 5 or 10 Euro to the Document Foundation and that is not too little or unimportant. I even think these are the contributions that count most, as there is strength in numbers. The Document Foundation was founded on the believe that is not only possible to develop a competing productivity suite as open source, but also to do so independent from any one single vendor or supporter. So huge numbers of small donations as opposed to bigger donations from a selected few support the very idea that the Document Foundation stands for.And there is even some evidence that the long tail of individuals interested and contributing to the project each for maybe completely different reasons can make the project much stronger than focusing on a single consumer of the product(). The most impressive evidence of this thesis is the creation of Unix in the way it was able to change the world. It was an accident, as the unusual circumstances of its birth prevented it to be choked by sort sighted commercial interest in the beginning and instead allowed the creation of a hugely successful broader ecosystem:In 1956, AT&amp;T had agreed to a U.S government consent decree that prevented the company from selling products not directly related to telephones and telecommunications, in return for its legal monopoly status in running the country's long-distance phone service. So Unix could not be sold as a product. Instead, AT&amp;T released the Unix source code under license to anyone who asked, charging only a nominal fee.And the rest is history.So, if you think that any or all of the following is true:LibreOffice is a very important open source project that needs your support.LibreOffice can and should get much better still.LibreOffice is important for the success of the open source desktop as a whole.LibreOffice is important for the success of the open source ecosystem as a whole.please join me and make your contribution today. Dont worry about the amount, every bit counts.

Regressions are a most annoying artifact that unfortunately comes with software development and QA. However, regressions are a misfeature we want to deal with quick and early as they might get harder and harder to triage and fix as time passes.\nBecause the way git stores its stuff, this download:\n&nbsp;http://people.canonical.com/~bjoern/bibisect-3.5.tar.lzmacontains:\n53 complete Linux 64-bit office installs (compiled on Ubuntu 11.10, but should work elsewhere too) between the creation of the core repo and the -3-5 branchoff (that is ~5000 commits)at 450MB each, that would be ~22GB totalhowever, it is only 749MB total download size, that is  less than 15MB per installationAnd one does not need to install them in parallel as one can switch through all of them with a quick \"git checkout source-hash-XXXXXX\" -- one switch costs &lt;1 second).\nNow how does one use this for cornering a regression? Well, this is where the power of bisecting comes in. First you download the tarball and unpack it:\n&gt; wget http://people.canonical.com/~bjoern/bibisect-3.5.tar.lzma\n&gt; tar --lzma -xf bibisect-3.5.tar.lzma\n&gt; cd bibisect-3.5\n&gt; # to verify your download was not corrupted do a: git tag -v latest\n&gt; # you need my gpg-key from https://launchpad.net/~bjoern-michaelsen for that\n\nThen you get yourself the newest build included in the download and check if your bug it there:\n&gt; git checkout latest\n&gt; ./opt/program/soffice.bin\n\nThen get the oldest build included in the download and check that the regression is not there:\n&gt; git checkout oldest\n&gt; ./opt/program/soffice.bin\n\nIf the bug is already present at this point, it is not a regression in the range that is covered by the download, but an even older bug.\nIf the bug is not there it is a regression in the range covered by the download and we can corner it down very well now. Do:\n&gt; git bisect start latest oldest\n\nto start bisecting. Then repeat these commands:\n&gt; ./opt/program/soffice.bin\n&gt; git bisect good # if the bug is not there\n&gt; git bisect bad # if the bug is there\n\nafter some ~5 repetitions, git will tell you something like this:\n9625329ea5a7e3e8475cd21c07726beec20573bd is the first bad commit\ncommit 9625329ea5a7e3e8475cd21c07726beec20573bd\nAuthor: Bjoern Michaelsen &lt;bjoern.michaelsen@canonical.com&gt;\nDate:&nbsp;&nbsp; Thu Dec 8 12:29:59 2011 +0100\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source-hash-2d19e9bb07ccff3134f855812dddfda5c07b1fe4\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; commit 2d19e9bb07ccff3134f855812dddfda5c07b1fe4\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Author:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jan Holesovsky &lt;kendy@suse.cz&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AuthorDate: Wed Nov 16 14:17:03 2011 +0100\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commit:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jan Holesovsky &lt;kendy@suse.cz&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommitDate: Wed Nov 16 14:21:33 2011 +0100\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kill one usage of chrel.sed to fix build.\n\nAppend that (the source-hash-2d19e9bb07ccff3134f855812dddfda5c07b1fe4 line is the important one) and the output of:\n&gt; git bisect log\n\nWhich should look something like this:\ngit bisect start 'latest' 'oldest'\n# good: [2faf4bc12ab490370d2196dedbc8091f9b09d0a5] source-hash-418a35f4861e863feb39eec73f4a39a87fbcb1f3\ngit bisect good 2faf4bc12ab490370d2196dedbc8091f9b09d0a5\n# bad: [b6fca7e58854bc617c5fc9a75d1c1720b0d7e1a4] source-hash-ce60138d339a5eb2a174a5d27063249acf2cac42\ngit bisect bad b6fca7e58854bc617c5fc9a75d1c1720b0d7e1a4\n# good: [0a28a62d53e996cf66d86e9bfb63ddc6ade75b7e] source-hash-71cbcb62028295a98ceee60cb4c4ee425bafcd2e\ngit bisect good 0a28a62d53e996cf66d86e9bfb63ddc6ade75b7e\n# bad: [9625329ea5a7e3e8475cd21c07726beec20573bd] source-hash-2d19e9bb07ccff3134f855812dddfda5c07b1fe4\ngit bisect bad 9625329ea5a7e3e8475cd21c07726beec20573bd\n# good: [89d91bb6074026dc0894bcdc6aaf8f6124102da7] source-hash-fb754a0df859e30255c25af8fa19bfaa75f257e7\ngit bisect good 89d91bb6074026dc0894bcdc6aaf8f6124102da7\n\nto the bug and the developers will have a very good idea where your bug is -- in this case between the commits fb754a0df859e30255c25af8fa19bfaa75f257e7 (good) and 2d19e9bb07ccff3134f855812dddfda5c07b1fe4 (bad) on master.
