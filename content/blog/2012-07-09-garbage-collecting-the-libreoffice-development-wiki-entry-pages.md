Garbage collecting the LibreOffice development wiki entry pages
===============================================================

<div style="text-align:right;"><em>"Oh, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it"</em>
-- Faith No More, "We Care A Lot"</div>
<div>

I just cleaned and sorted the LibreOffice development pages:</div>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development" rel="nofollow">Development</a> (compare the <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/index.php?title=Development&amp;oldid=51283" rel="nofollow">old version</a>)</li>
	<li><a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Native_Build" rel="nofollow">How to Build</a> (compare the <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/index.php?title=Development/Native_Build&amp;oldid=52283" rel="nofollow">old version</a>)</li>
</ul>
which still contained lots of old, obsolete and even misleading content in a huge unsorted page, which likely nobody bothered to clean up because it ... was a huge unsorted page. I hope the new pages with lots of obsolete stuff killed and lots of nonessential/reference stuff moved down to the end of the page, leaving the top of the page for the essentials will make life quite a bit easier for new contributors!
