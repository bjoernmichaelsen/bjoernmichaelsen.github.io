Garbage collecting the LibreOffice development wiki entry pages
===============================================================

<div style="text-align: right;"><em>
"Oh, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it"</br>
-- Faith No More, "We Care A Lot"</br>
</em></div>


I just cleaned and sorted the LibreOffice development pages:

* [Development](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development) (compare the [old version](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/index.php?title=Development&oldid=51283))
* [How to Build](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Native_Build) (compare the [old version](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/index.php?title=Development/Native_Build&oldid=52283))

which still contained lots of old, obsolete and even misleading content in a
huge unsorted page, which likely nobody bothered to clean up because it ... was
a huge unsorted page. I hope the new pages with lots of obsolete stuff killed
and lots of nonessential/reference stuff moved down to the end of the page,
leaving the top of the page for the essentials will make life quite a bit
easier for new contributors!
