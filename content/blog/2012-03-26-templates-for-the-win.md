Templates for the win!
======================

There is so much going on in the world of LibreOffice, that my "must blog about
this"-list gets longer and longer. Here is another little gem that had to wait
far to long to get dragged into the limelight. Jussi Schultink kicked this one
of with [a bit of an grumble post](http://jussi01.com/2012/03/17/templates-and-defaults/) about the default settings and templates in
LibreOffice. But the beauty of free software is that you are not left with
grumbling as your first, last and only resort -- so [Jussi](https://launchpad.net/~jussi01) teamed up with
[Alan Bell](https://launchpad.net/~alanbell) and founded the ["Ubuntu Template Curators"](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntutemplates)
to change and improve the situation. I connected the Template Curators with
Stefan Knorr, Christoph Noack of LibreOffice User Experience and Design Team.
Quickly Alexander Wilms of template and design creation fame also joined the
bunch. With this team, I am looking forward for some amazing new templates and
defaults improvements in LibreOffice 3.6/Ubuntu P+1!

If you are interested in getting beautiful templates into LibreOffice, Im sure
these guys would love to hear from you!

<sup>(1)</sup> Or just want to show off in front of your friends, because people all over the world are using your template for their presentation ;)
