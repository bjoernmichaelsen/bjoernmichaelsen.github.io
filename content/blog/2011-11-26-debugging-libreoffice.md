debugging LibreOffice
=====================

Debugging LibreOffice has just been made easier for developers. After you have made a developer installation with<br /><ul><li>make dev-install</li></ul>you can (on Linux only for now) run:<br /><ul><li>make debugrun</li></ul>which will start you freshly build LibreOffice, while keeping an eye on it with gdb.
