LibreOffice on Ubuntu 11.04 'Natty Narwhal'
==========================================

Ubuntu 11.04 'Natty Narwhal' has been released on April 28th, 2011 and is the first Ubuntu release to contain a LibreOffice in the default install.

A few days after the official release, it indeed seems to be a overall smooth transition. Apart from the move from OpenOffice.org to LibreOffice, there are some other exciting changes in this Ubuntu release: The LibreOffice icons are not only used in LibreOffice itself, but also on the dash and in the default theme for Nautilus. So the new icons are consistently being used in the whole desktop experience. Congratulations to the LibreOffice Design team for this success!

Also, by installing the [lo-menubar package](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lo-menubar) you can already enable the [LibreOffice Integration with Unity that was created by Alberto Ruiz](http://aruiz.synaptia.net/siliconisland/2011/02/introducing-libreoffice-integration-with-unitys-application-menubar.html). The code for this feature has already been [upstreamed to LibreOffice](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/libs-core/tree/framework/source/lomenubar) and is also on the 3.4 branch and thus will be part of upcoming releases.

So: Where do we go from here? Work on [Ubuntu 11.10 'Oneiric Ocelot'](http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/646) is starting right now. In fact, the first fixes to critical issues related to LibreOffice have [already been released](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/hunspell-en-us/+bug/773646). More to come soon!

A great thanks to all who make these awesome developments possible and a special thanks to Rene Engelhard for his hard work on debian packaging.
