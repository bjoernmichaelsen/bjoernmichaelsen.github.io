Gerrit for LibreOffice
======================

<div style="text-align: right;"><em>
Sometimes I give myself the creeps</br>
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me</br>
It all keeps adding up</br>
I think I'm cracking up</br>
Am I just paranoid?</br>
-- Basket Case, Green Day</br>
</em></div>

It seems like the
[gerrit for LibreOffice](https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/)
is ready for primetime now. I updated a sweet and short
[introduction](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/gerrit)
on how to use it. If you want your first patch in LibreOffice, with gerrit you wont need a mailing list subscribe, a freedesktop account or any other administrative overhead. You just need this:

* [say hello to gerrit](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/gerrit/setup)
* [give it your patches](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/gerrit/SubmitPatch)
* done

For core developers, who want to review uploaded patches, this is needed:

* [say hello to gerrit](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/gerrit/setup)
* [find and get patches from it](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/gerrit/PatchReview)
* done

I hope, we can again lower the barrier to entry for new contributors and make the progress of LibreOffice more transparent with this. In addition, it will simplify the discussion of certain changes and give it some more structure. Finally, this enables us to significantly improve the use of our
[tinderboxes](http://tinderbox.libreoffice.org/MASTER/status.html)
. I expect [a lot of good things](http://nabble.documentfoundation.org/probabilistic-approach-to-tinderboxing-td3989662.html) to happen there soon.
