Easy Hacks by Topic
===================

Just a short note:<br /><br />I finally created the <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Easy_Hacks_by_Topic">Easy Hacks by Topic</a> page. If you are for example only interested in UI relevant work, you easily find ~30 related open Easy Hacks on the topic page now. So all our Easy Hacks overviews are now:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Easy_Hacks">Easy Hack Intro and Selection</a></li><li><a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Easy_Hacks_by_required_Skill">Easy Hacks by required Skill</a></li><li><a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Easy_Hacks_by_Topic">Easy Hacks by Topic</a></li><li><a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Easy_Hacks_by_Difficulty">Easy Hacks by Difficulty</a></li></ul>To get your Easy Hack sorted in you need to use the <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Easy_Hacks_Bugzilla_Whiteboard_Status">whiteboard status</a>.
