Writer Again!
=============

After resigning from the [Board of Directors of
TDF](https://community.documentfoundation.org/t/resigning-from-the-board-of-directors-of-tdf/12095)
over the weekend, I hope I will again find more time to look into the technical details of LibreOffice Writer. I will also try to do my best to write some good article here about the depth of that application. While a text processor in itself is not that interesting anymore these days, the challenges of migrating that big old legacy code might be fascinating quite often. Hope to have you as a reader for that soon!
