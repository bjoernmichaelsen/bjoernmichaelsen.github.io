LibreOffice 3.6.0 beta 1 preview packaged in ppa
============

Since a few days the
[libreoffice-prereleases ppa](https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/libreoffice-prereleases)
has [a version of LibreOffice 3.6.0 beta 1 packaged for Ubuntu precise (12.04 LTS)](https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/libreoffice-prereleases/+sourcepub/2499304/+listing-archive-extra)
as a preview. It is not a release as it would end up in would end up in Ubuntu
Quantal or one you would want to use on a productive system --
[all the warnings for the 3.6.0 alpha 1 package](http://nabble.documentfoundation.org/Re-Libreoffice-qa-ANN-LibreOffice-3-6-0-ALPHA1-test-builds-available-tp3988242p3988427.html)
still apply. So install this in a VM of your
choice and go viciously testing on it! You are also invited to try out and
explore all the
[new features](http://blog.documentfoundation.org/2012/06/03/new-and-changed-features-experience-and-test-them-now/)
of LibreOffice 3.6.x that Cor has so helpfully
collected together in the linked blog posts!

Happy testing!
