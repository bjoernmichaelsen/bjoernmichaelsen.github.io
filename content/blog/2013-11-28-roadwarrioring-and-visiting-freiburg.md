Roadwarrioring and visiting Freiburg
====================================

<p style="text-align:right;"><em>He asked me if I'd seen a road with so much dust and sand.</em>
<em> And I said, "Listen, I've travelled every road in this here land!"</em>
<em> I've been everywhere, man.</em>
<em> I've been everywhere, man.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmFN9C9PVpg"><em>I've been Everywhere, Johnny Cash</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So about a month ago I travelled in one week from Hamburg via ZÃ¼rich and San Francisco to Oakland and then via San Francisco, Munich and Basel to Freiburg to attend the <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Hackfest/Freiburg2013">LibreOffice Hackfest Freiburg 2013</a> and back to Hamburg. The Freiburg Hackfest is the third and last Hackevent we had in Germany this year (after the <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Marketing/Events/ImpressSprint2013">Impress Sprint in Dresden</a> and the <a href="http://erack.org/blog/archives/28-LibreOffice-Hamburg-Hackfest-Retrospective.html">Hackfest in Hamburg</a>) nicely accompanying the international events like the <a href="http://conference.libreoffice.org/2013/en">LibreOffice conference in Milan</a> and our <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Marketing/Events/Fosdem2013">usual presence at FOSDEM</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">I have to admit that I arrived at this event with some travel fatigue and some upcoming <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ubuflu&amp;src=typd">Ubuflu</a>, so I was not too productive myself, but its good to see fixes like for example in the kde integration (Jan-Marek), in Calc (Eilidh), for enabling bitcoin donations (Florian), to mail merge (again Jan-Marek), to Math (Marcos), for the build system (Michael and David) happening (or at least be prepared at the event). A big "Thank You" to all the angels of the Chaos Computer Club Freiburg that organized the event -- when I learned that I would need to travel to the US right before this, I had some doubts if it would result in "remote-organization-troubles" given this was a first time in Freiburg. This was completely unfounded, the support of our hosts was amazing and they seemed to have made a deal with Eris to take revenge for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism#Original_Snub">original snub</a> somewhere else on this weekend. ;)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So, given that I did not do much coding (just some preparation for the <a href="http://nabble.documentfoundation.org/Building-LibreOffice-from-an-IDE-td4083960.html">KDevelop integration for LibreOffice</a>, more on that later), what can I offer you? Catcontent was not available (no cats at this Hackfest), so I give you the second best thing: the deputy chairman of the board of the Document Foundation patrolling the premises on a skateboard:</p>

So, whats next? FOSDEM! We will of course be there again, and back-to-back with the event we will have a user experience Hackfest in Bruessels. So come and <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Hackfest/FOSDEM2014">join us</a>:
