Move from LiveJournal
=====================

<p style="text-align:right;"><em>I'm going slightly mad</em>
<em> It finally happened</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">-- Queen, Innuendo, I'm going slightly mad</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As question "why does my post not appear to be visible to the world on the blog hours after I posted" was replied with: "Yeah, that is just the caching. There is nothing we can do about it". I finally decided to leave the <a href="http://sweetshark.livejournal.com/">old home</a>. Should have done that a lot earlier, I guess: The post is still not up almost six hours later.</p>
