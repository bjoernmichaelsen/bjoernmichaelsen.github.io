Move to wordpress
=================

<div style="text-align: right;"><em>
I’m going slightly mad</br>
It finally happened!</br>
-- Queen, Innuendo, I’m going slightly mad</br>
</em></div>

As question “why does my post not appear to be visible to the world on the blog
hours after I posted” was replied with: “Yeah, that is just the caching. There
is nothing we can do about it”. I finally decided to go
[somewhere else](http://skyfromme.wordpress.com/).
Should have done that a lot earlier, I guess: The post is still not up almost six
hours later.
