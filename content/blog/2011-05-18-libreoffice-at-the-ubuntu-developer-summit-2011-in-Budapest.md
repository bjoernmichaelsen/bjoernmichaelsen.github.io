LibreOffice at the Ubuntu Developer Summit 2011 in Budapest
===========================================================

This has been my first [Ubuntu Developer Summit](http://uds.ubuntu.com/) and therefore also my first chance to meet up with the [Canonical Desktop Team](https://launchpad.net/~canonical-desktop-team/+mugshots) in person. I had been warned before that UDS is an exciting, exhausting, enlightening and inspiring experience and I was not disappointed on any of these points. The [schedule](http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-o/) is just mindblowing, the [location](http://www.corinthia.com/en/Budapest/home/) was great, even though little was seen from the outside world, because there was always something that needed urgent discussion. Luckily I have been in Budapest last year already for the last (in every meaning of the word, it seems) OOoCon.

I drafted two blueprints about LibreOffice which were discussed in sessions on Wednesday:

* [LibreOffice Packaging for Oneiric](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-o-libreoffice-packaging) [(session notes)](http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-o/meeting/desktop-o-libreoffice-packaging/)
* [Connect LibreOffice Communities](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-o-libreoffice-communities) [(session notes)](http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-o/meeting/desktop-o-libreoffice-communities/)

It was also great to able to have a nice short chat with [Alberto Ruiz](https://launchpad.net/~alberto.ruiz) and [Ted Gould](https://launchpad.net/~ted) about the [LibreOffice Unity integration](http://sweetshark.livejournal.com/857.html) and finally also meet other contributors to the LibreOffice project (for example: [Vish](https://launchpad.net/~vish), [KAMI](https://launchpad.net/~kami911) and [Robert Roth](https://launchpad.net/~evfool)) and members of the [Ubuntu Documentation](https://launchpad.net/~jwcampbell) and [Translation](https://launchpad.net/~dpm) teams with an interest in LibreOffice and its place on the desktop.

On a side note: My flight there was delayed, making me miss my connecting flight, but that allowed me flighting through the dusk, which is always so beautiful, that I would like to share a view of that with you:
