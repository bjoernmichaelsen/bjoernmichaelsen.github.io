New LibreOffice Ubuntu versions
===============================

There have been some uploads of new Ubuntu versions of LibreOffice recently:

* [LibreOffice 1:3.5.0~beta2-2ubuntu3 for Precise Pagolin](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libreoffice/1:3.5.0~beta2-2ubuntu3)
* [LibreOffice 1:3.4.5-0ubuntu1~ppa1 for Oneiric Ocelot (11.10) (and its l10n version) in the LibreOffice PPA](https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/ppa/+sourcepub/2185488/+listing-archive-extra)

LibreOffice 1:3.4.5-0ubuntu1 has just been uploaded to oneiric-proposed too to be [SRUed](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates) (it is exactly the same as the ppa version, except for the changed version).

If you want to help test any of these versions, you are most welcome!

P.S.: On a sidenote, I am slowly recovering from the "music" from a CD I was requested to listen to as a penalty for the unfortunate LibreOffice 1:3.5.0~beta2-2ubuntu2 upload causing some trouble upon update for many already on Precise. Thank you, Rick!
