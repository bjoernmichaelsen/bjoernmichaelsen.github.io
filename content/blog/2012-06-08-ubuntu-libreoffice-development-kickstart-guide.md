Ubuntu LibreOffice Development Kickstart Guide
==============================================

This is a short note, that I wrote some short and concise wiki pages on
LibreOffice development on Ubuntu. Please dont tell me that there is way more
info on the TDF Wiki, thats true -- but also not the point: In fact, there is
quite possibly too much information on the TDF wiki  ;). So this is the
stripped down info on what you really need to know to start working on
[LibreOffice on Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibreOffice):

* [Building LibreOffice](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BuildingLibreOffice)
* [Debugging LibreOffice](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingLibreOffice)
* [Packaging LibreOffice](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibreOfficePackaging)

Also note the older page by Christopher M. Penalver about Bug Filing against LibreOffice on Ubuntu:

* [Bug reporting against LibreOffice on Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibreOfficeBugWrangling)

completing the bunch.
