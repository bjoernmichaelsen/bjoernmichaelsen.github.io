LibreOffice bugzilla status
===========================

<p style="text-align:right;"><em>Im kind of over gettin told to throw my hands up in the air</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><em> so there</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtdK_Y5iZnU"><em>Team, Pure Herione, Lorde</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So, somewhere between the LibreOffice 4.2.0 and the 4.1.5 release, <a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/">bugs.freedesktop.org</a> broke through 25.000 reported bugs. A time to throw the hands up in despair? Not at all, as the following chart shows:</p>


[caption id="attachment_780" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="/img/wp/2014/02/fdobugstate.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-780" alt="LibreOffice bug states on freedesktop" src="/img/wp/2014/02/fdobugstate.png?w=300" width="300" height="194" /></a> LibreOffice bug states on freedesktop[/caption]
<ul>
	<li>7% of reports are still unconfirmed or need more information</li>
	<li>22% are confirmed and unresolved issues, that are not enhancements requests</li>
	<li>6.5% are unresolved enhancement requests.</li>
</ul>
On the other hand:
<ul>
	<li>33% of all reports have been fixed in some way</li>
	<li>and 30% are invalid or duplicates.</li>
</ul>
Its interesting to see how now a quarter of the confirmed unresolved reports are asking for new features and enhancements. Its gets even more encouraging, if you take into account that the number of bugs reports is at a long term constant 20-25 reports per day, while over 40% of the bugs intentionally or collaterally fixed changed their state in the last 12 month. So we are picking up speed in triaging and fixing bugs, while the influx of new reports stays constant.

If you are interested, please help QA quite a bit in all this by writing good bug reports, identifying duplicates, confirming new reports, <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Bibisect">bibisecting regressions</a>, run and test daily builds and prereleases or otherwise helping with the <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/QA/Easy_Hacks">QA Easy Hacks!</a>
