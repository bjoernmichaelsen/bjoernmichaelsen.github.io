Invitation to the LibreOffice Hackfest Hamburg 2018 on April 7th and 8th

Its once again time to meet again in Hamburg for a LibreOffice Hackfest! We will meet with contributors to LibreOffice – old and new – and also welcome those who have not yet contributed to the project, but are interested in doing so. This will also be the first <a href="https://skyfromme.wordpress.com/2017/08/27/hackfests-the-next-generation/">Hackfest TNG</a>.

We will have <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/EasyHacks">EasyHacks</a> prepared for anyone wanting to do their first code contribution to the project – and we will have mentors around who may provide guidance to every interested newcomer. An Hackfest is the easiest way to get involved for a curious newcomers to the project: we certainly can offer an interesting C++ codebase!

Not interested in coding? As the local German LibreOffice community joins this Hackfest, non-coding topics like documentation, QA and marketing especially in the German context will be discussed too. This is an opportunity to meet those active in the German community and plan and coordinate how to push the project, the product and the brand of LibreOffice in the German context. Mixing and mingling of the German community with the international developer community is a bonus for both: otherwise this only happens at the frantic and busy meetings at <a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> and the <a href="https://conference.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice conference</a>, where usually time is a very restricted resource for everyone.

Note that as <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Hackfest/Hamburg2018#Travel_Bursaries">usual support for travel and accommodation</a> for the Hackfest is available from <a href="https://www.documentfoundation.org/">The Document Foundation</a> as per its <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/TDF/Policies/Refunding">travel policy</a>, so please feel invited to make use of that offer, especially if you have always been curious about the LibreOffice project and you want to get involved, but are not quite sure how: a Hackfest is a great way to learn that.

So – where will we meet? Here:

<a href="https://skyfromme.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/6fwd.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1438" src="https://skyfromme.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/6fwd.jpg" alt="6fwd" width="3104" height="608" /></a>

This is 6Fwd – a beautiful meeting room at <a href="https://freiheit.com/en/">freiheit.com technologies</a>, who are generously hosting us for this event. I am very excited about us being guests at this location and would like to thank freiheit.com for their sponsorship!

<strong><a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Hackfest/Hamburg2018">Details about the LibreOffice Hackfest Hamburg 2018 are kept on the TDF wiki page</a></strong> and will be continuously updated. If you are interested in joining the event please start adding your name there (especially if you are interested in TDF sponsoring travel and accomodation for you).

<small>(If you are still unsure about joining the event, you can have a look at the <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Special:PrefixIndex/Hackfest/">wiki pages of previous events</a> to get an idea. But really: the best way to learn about the project is going to a Hackfest, so dont miss this opportunity!)</small>
