LibreOffice 3.5.3 for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and updated bibisect
===========================================================

As [announced](http://blog.documentfoundation.org/2012/05/02/the-document-foundation-announces-libreoffice-3-5-3/) by The Document Foundation, LibreOffice 3.5.3 has been released
today. Ubuntu users who cant wait to have this release on their system, can
install it from the [LibreOffice PPA](https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/ppa) right now. As far as I know, this is the
first time that we have a Ubuntu package ready and build on the day of the
release (3.5.3rc2 is 3.5.3 final), and this is the result of the simplification
that both Debian and Ubuntu did in their packaging between 3.4 and 3.5. This
package is also [currently building in precise-proposed](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+source/libreoffice) and will be a
[Stable Release Update](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates) for Ubuntu Precise. Since ~all the
[changelog bugs](http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/pending-sru.html) have already
been verified, this hopefully will be available as an automatic update to all
users of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in one or two weeks.

I also updated the bibisect repository for LibreOffice 3.6. In now contains
[62 LibreOffice installations from December 8th (LibreOffice 3.5 branch off) to April, 28th in one 1.1GB download](http://people.canonical.com/~bjoern/bibisect-3.6-20120428.tar.xz).
