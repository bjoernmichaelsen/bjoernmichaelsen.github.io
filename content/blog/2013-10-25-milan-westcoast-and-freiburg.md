Milan, West Coast and Freiburg
==============================

<p style="text-align:right;"><em>We gonna do what they say can't be done</em>
<em> We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnRwQjTYfGI"><em>-- East Bound and Down, Jerry Reed</em></a></p>
So, the <a href="http://conference.libreoffice.org/2013/en">LibreOffice conference in Milan</a> is just past us and it was awesome -- if you missed it, Kohei posted a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152269212828219.1073741826.624343218&amp;type=1&amp;l=26d22cf2c5">very nice set of pictures from that event</a>. If you are interested in the talks too, you can find both <a href="http://conference.libreoffice.org/2013/en/streams">streams</a> and <a href="http://conference.libreoffice.org/talks/2013/">slides</a> for almost all the talks. One other talk from the conference, I would like to hightlight is <a href="http://conference.libreoffice.org/talks/2013/content/sessions/050/files/LOConf2013_gbuild.pdf">Michael Stahls gbuild talk</a> -- it was a long journey from when gbuild was still a pet project of mine, but now as the migration is now finished, things unlocked and we <sup>(*)</sup> are now really reaping what we sowed.

Almost, as e.g. while I was able and eager to send the slides for the lightning talks I moderated, I somehow forgot to do so for my own slides for my talk on tb3. It will hopefully end up on the conference site at some point, but for now I uploaded at at <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/sweetshark1">speakerdeck</a> (with the odp originals on the <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/User:Bjoern-michaelsen">wiki </a>and <a href="http://people.canonical.com/~bjoern/presentations/">here</a>):

I didnt bring my own camera and thus missed making pictures during e.g. the lively QA roundtable, but Rob made sure that we get at least some photo on the last day (when many were already on the way home):

<p style="text-align:left;">So in the next days, I will be hopping over atlantic for a visit to the west coast, just to return to turnÂ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnRwQjTYfGI"><em>"eastbound and down, loaded up and trucking"</em></a> to be at <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Hackfest/Freiburg2013">Freiburg for the Hackfest</a> again. A big Thank You in advance to Tauon and Florian Effenberger, who took over a lot of my organizer duties on this one due to this tight scheduling. Oh, and of course, I hope to see many of you there!</p>
