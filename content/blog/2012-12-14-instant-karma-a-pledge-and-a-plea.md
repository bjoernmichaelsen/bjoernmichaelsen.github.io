Instant Karma -- a pledge and a plea
====================================

<div style="text-align:right;"><em>"Instant Karma's gonna get you</em></div>
<p style="text-align:right;"><em> Gonna knock you right on the head"</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3qvosHHcWc">-- John Lennon, Instant Karma</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Last year before Christmas, I donated <a href="http://sweetshark.livejournal.com/2011/12/03/">220 Euro to the Document Foundation</a> and I hope it helped as a tiny contribution to all the awesome things that happened with the Document Foundation and LibreOffice in this year, like getting volunteers to our events, providing food and drinks at Hackfests etc..</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This year I will try to do this a bit different. I think donating to the Document Foundation is as important as ever: the developments of the last year show that we are approaching a vital decision point and we are accelerating while doing so. While the Document Foundation is fighting for freedom in software and productivity, its easy to forget that to profit from the benefits of this work even more basic freedom and rights -- easily taken for granted -- are required. Still many have to fight hard for those.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://www.witness.org/">Witness.org</a> is one organization that helps to make human rights and freedom universal by letting no violation pass unobserved. As I firmly believe freedom to be essential regardless of scale or context, I hereby pledge to donate 10 Euro to witness.org for every power of 2 in Euros donated to the Document Foundation in December 2012. That is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 Euro donated to the Document Foundation in December 2012 =&gt; I will donate 10 Euros to witness.org</li>
	<li>2 Euros donated to the Document Foundation in December 2012 =&gt; I will donate 20 Euros to witness.org</li>
	<li>4 Euros donated to the Document Foundation in December 2012 =&gt; I will donate 30 Euros to witness.org</li>
	<li>8 Euros donated to the Document Foundation in December 2012 =&gt; I will donate 40 Euros to witness.org</li>
	<li>16 Euros donated to the Document Foundation in December 2012 =&gt; I will donate 50 Euros to witness.org</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ul>
So please: Make me pay!
