Take It Easy
============

<div style="text-align: right;"> <em>Don&rsquo;t let the sound of your own</em></div><div style="text-align: right;"> <em>Wheels drive you crazy</em><br /> <span style="font-size:smaller;"><i>-- Eagles, Take It Easy</i></span></div><!--/em-->Our own success with the EasyHacks -- a list of things to do for newcomers to get started with the LibreOffice project -- was a bit overwhelming: The amount of things to do and the amount of things getting done in short periods of time made the EasyHacks wiki page a hub of activity -- but it also became quickly confusing to the unsuspecting newcomer, who might soon feel like experiencing a <a href="http://hacks.mit.edu/by_year/1991/fire_hydrant/fire_hydrant.html">MIT-style firehose education</a>. So after a <a href="http://nabble.documentfoundation.org/Re-tdf-discuss-Re-EasyHack-on-EasyHacks-td2750672.html">lively discussion on the dev@ mailing list</a> we decided to take the main chunk of the task handling to bugzilla.<br /><br />So here they are, your shiny new EasyHacks:<ul> <li>  <a href="http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Easy_Hacks">Easy Hacks Start Page</a></li> <li>  <a href="http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Easy_Hacks_by_required_Skill">Easy Hacks by Required Skill</a></li> <li>  <a href="http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Easy_Hacks_by_Difficulty">Easy Hacks by Difficulty</a></li></ul>You might miss &quot;Easy Hacks by Topic&quot; and &quot;Easy Hacks by Component&quot; and a few others, and you are right. And as with so many things at LibreOffice -- <a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39753">there is an EasyHack for it</a>.<br /><br />So while I will return to my vacation now, I wish you all some <strong>happy hacking</strong>!<br /><br />P.S.:<br />This might be a good time to check and update &quot;your&quot; EasyHacks:<ul> <li>If you are working on an Easy Hack and have a bugzilla account by now, you can assign it to yourself.</li> <li>If you have finished an Easy Hack, you can close it on bugzilla.</li> <li>If you have created Easy Hacks you might want to update their <a href="http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Easy_Hacks_Bugzilla_Whiteboard_Status">tags</a>, so that it shows up in the right lists. This is especially true for <a href="http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Easy_Hacks_by_required_Skill#Skill_Level:_Unknown_8">these Easy Hacks</a>.</li></ul>
