One and Only
============

<p style="text-align:right;"><em>I am the one and only nobody I'd rather be</em></p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Just a short note: I have missed the exact date in the release madness for Ubuntu 13.04 Raring, but a few days ago something important silently happened: <strong>All supported Ubuntu releases are now shipping with LibreOffice by default</strong>, as trusty old Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx) reached its end of support for the desktop. So we now have these supported releases:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) with LibreOffice 3.5</li>
	<li>Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) with LibreOffice 3.6</li>
	<li>Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) with LibreOffice 4.0</li>
	<li>and upcoming: Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) with LibreOffice 4.1</li>
</ul>
Also the following releases (which are not supported anymore) have been done in addition:
<ul>
	<li>Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) with LibreOffice 3.3</li>
	<li>Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot) with LibreOffice 3.4</li>
</ul>
Looking back in time at the angstridden, not-acting-but-reacting excitement of the early days and comparing it with the way we are really pushing the envelope now, we have really come a long way, improving with every step on the way. Well worth a celebration with one of the most cheesy 1990ies hits ever - Thanks to everyone, who was and is part of this!
