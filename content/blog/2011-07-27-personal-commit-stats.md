personal commit stats
=====================

Since the release of 3.4.2 (which will be included in Ubuntu Oneiric) is around the corner and I will be soon go on vacation I thought it might be a good time to take look at how I am doing contribution wise. Using the totally unscientific method of commit counting, I came up with the following numbers.<br />Of all the changes to master since February 1st, 2011 (the day I joined Canonical), I commited 561. Their authorship is:<br /><ul><li>326 by Bjoern Michaelsen (yours truely)</li><li>103 by Michael Stahl</li><li>59 by Mathias Bauer</li><li>31 by Henning Brinkmann</li><li>15 by Phillip Lohmann</li><li>10 by Ocke Jansen</li><li>4 by Ivo Hinkelmann</li><li>3 by Daniel Rentz</li><li>2 by Mat&uacute;&scaron; Kukan</li><li>1 by Alberto Ruiz, Andras Timar, Eric Bachard, Jani Monoses, Matthias Klose, Michael Meeks, Sergey Davidoff and Xisco Fauli each</li></ul>In addition Michael Meeks and Fridrich &Scaron;trba each commited one of my changesets. So in total I had some role in 563 of the 11.756 changes done to master in the given timeframe -- or about 4.8%.<br />Just counting self-authored and self-commited changesets, my 326 were outperformed by:<ul><li>Fridrich &Scaron;trba (330)</li><li>David Tardon (406)</li><li>Miklos Vajna (407)</li><li>Petr Mladek (415)</li><li>Kohei Yoshida (500)</li><li>Thomas Arnhold (634)</li><li>Tor Lillqvist (1014)</li><li>and our absolute rockstar Caol&aacute;n McNamara with 1865 commits.</li></ul>Congratulations and a big thank you to all of you!
