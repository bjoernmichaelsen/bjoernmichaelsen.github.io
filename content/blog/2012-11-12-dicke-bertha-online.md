Dicke Bertha online.
====================

<p style="text-align:right;"><em>Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz ?</em>
<em> My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><em>-- Janis Joplin, Mercedes-Benz</em></p>
So one cycle is over, UDS is done, blueprints are mangled -- so far nothing different for me from anyone else working on Ubuntu around this time. Ah, but then there is one more thing that is special for a LibreOffice maintainer: new hardware. Shortly before UDS I consider updating my hardware for the next cycle. This time, I did -- here is my new baby:

<a href="/static/img/wp/2012/11/bertha2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-228" title="Dicke Bertha" alt="" src="/static/img/wp/2012/11/bertha2.jpg" height="775" width="519" /></a>

Although I name my machines usually after the element of having the same proton number as the last part of the local IP, this time it was different: She already had a name, before I even could make up my mind about IPs: Bastian and Claus from <a href="http://www.picom.eu/">picom</a>, who went though some extra trouble to build this beast, affectionately and unofficially called her "Big Bertha" -- presumably a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bertha_%28howitzer%29">historical reference</a>. Given that this "desktop" with 32 cores and 32GB RAM builds LibreOffice in 18 minutes flat (or 3 minutes 20 seconds with a warm ccache), I could not help but to keep that name.

In total this gives me this as workhorses:

<a href="/static/img/wp/2012/11/desk.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-229" title="... workhorses ..." alt="" src="/static/img/wp/2012/11/desk.jpg" height="347" width="519" /></a>
<ul>
	<li>left: Thinkpad W520 -- i7-27020QM with 16GB RAM (once called 'mobile buildserver' by my colleagues at Canonical)</li>
	<li>center: Sun X7197A screen and a Unicomp Customizer keyboard for Big Bertha</li>
	<li>also center: Nexus 7 (running Ubuntu), Galaxy SII (running Android), trusty old Casio CFX-9850GB plus</li>
	<li>right: Ideapad S12</li>
</ul>
The Casio is clearly the weakest computer of those, but still is more powerful than the first one I ever owned. And finally, next to the table:

<a href="/static/img/wp/2012/11/all2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-230" title="... and the old stuff." alt="" src="/static/img/wp/2012/11/all2.jpg" height="775" width="519" /></a>
<ul>
	<li>Big Bertha</li>
	<li>below the printer: my old IBM x3800 that I would fire up for emergency extra compile power or when it was getting too cold in the room (now decommissioned by Big Bertha, and on sale at ebay)</li>
	<li>behind the printer: old Asus Z53 running fileserver duties</li>
	<li>in front of the printer: original IBM Model M, for backup if the Unicomp should fail me</li>
	<li>the trusty old Sun Ultra 24, now replaced by Big Bertha (so decommissioned, and already sold)</li>
</ul>
Not in picture: A few routers and two Pandaboards. I guess I used up all my showboating credits for a few years now and promise to keep silent for a while on this.
