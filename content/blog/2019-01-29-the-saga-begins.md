The saga begins ...
===================

<p style="text-align:right;"><em>Oh, the Council was impressed, of course</em>
<em>Could he bring balance to the Force?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8lNmnzs64U">-- The Saga Begins, Weird Al Yankovic</a></em></p>
As you might have seen, we have now run <a href="https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2019/01/22/coming-up-on-24-january-next-c-workshop-set-and-maps/">four C++ sessions</a> to get started with C++ and LibreOffice development. The origin of this actually happened already at the last <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Hackfest/Muenchen2018">LibreOffice Hackfest in Munich</a> where Izabela, Mike, Anxhelo and me conspired on the idea. We also started to recruit LibreOffice developers as mentors right there and Xisco joined us soon.

As the lectures discuss the basics of data structures and C++ I started to create some patches against LibreOffice to show how to start with simple things in the LibreOffice build based on the examples from the lecture, but in the environment of LibreOffice and with some of its framework and conventions:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/#/c/65125/">A "Hello World!" program</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/#/c/66977/">A program that checks if some C++ source code snippet has properly balanced parathesis and curly braces</a></li>
</ul>
Some background and discussion about these can be found in the videos linked in the commit messages of these and on the <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Events/C%2B%2BLectures">C++ lectures wiki page</a>. I hope these small examples are helpful to someone starting with C++ and LibreOffice even if you might have missed the first C++ lecture sesssions.

Why am I posting this? Now? Well, tomorrow <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Events/2019/FOSDEM#Hackfest">the LibreOffice FOSDEM 2019 Hackfest</a> starts in Bruessls. As you can see from the above, awesome things often take off there! You dont have to take my word for it: <a href="https://forum.openlabs.cc/t/my-personal-experience-on-getting-involved-with-libreoffice-community/1477">Izabela</a> and <a href="https://lushka.al/libreoffice-hackfest-munich/">Anxhelo</a>Â wrote about their experiences too! If reading their report (or the story about how the lectures started) make you curious, please feel invited to join us in Bruessels at FOSDEM -- or if you cant make that, the next Hackfest!
