No global menubar in Ubuntu Oneiric by default
==============================================

This is a short note that the global menubar which integrated Libreoffice into Unity will not be enabled by default in the Ubuntu Oneiric release. It will still be installable with the package "lo-menubar". The reason is some remaining concern about stability which led to the more conservative decision to leave it opt-in for now.
