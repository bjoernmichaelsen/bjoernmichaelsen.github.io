Libreoffice for Windows -- builds and runs on Linux
===================================================

I just wanted to share this: <a href="http://nabble.documentfoundation.org/MinGW-cross-compilation-Runs-td3380547.html">MinGW cross-compilation: Runs!</a><br /><br />And with this I am sending out big kudos to Tor, Kendy and Fridrich for making this possible. Now this is still very a early implementation and not ready for productive use, but being able to cross compile (native) and run (in wine) a huge package like Libreoffice for Windows with a complete open source stack is a major achievement in itself. It shows not only the dynamic in the Libreoffice project, it is also a testament to the power of open source as a whole.<br /><br />P.S.: This post is intentionally not tagged libreoffice to keep it from showing up on planet documentfoundation -- I leave the glory of that to the main implementers.
