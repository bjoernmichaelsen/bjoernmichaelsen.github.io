Call for Testing: Ubuntu LibreOffice packages
=============================================

<div style="text-align: right;"><em>
Now these points of data make a beautiful line.</br>
And we're out of Beta.</br>
We're releasing on time.</br>

Yes, its true: We are out of Beta and we are releasing on time!  And if you are
adventurous, you can test the current LibreOffice 3.6.0 release candidate 1
from the [LibreOffice prereleases PPA](https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/libreoffice-prereleases):

* [for Quantal (Ubuntu 12.10)](https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/libreoffice-prereleases/+sourcepub/2567713/+listing-archive-extra)
* [for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise)](https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/libreoffice-prereleases/+sourcepub/2567709/+listing-archive-extra)

Please especially test [all the fancy new things in this release](http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/3.6)!

One late feature (came in with beta3) I would like to especially point out are
the new masterpages in Impress by Alexander Wilms, Mateus Machado Luna, Stefan
Knorr and all the other cool guys on the [LibreOffice design team](https://plus.google.com/102673546895803839652/posts). And before anyone screams "pics or it didnt happen!" -- here is a screenshot of them
running on Ubuntu Quantal:

In addition, for the more conservative folks
[LibreOffice 3.5.5 rc3 (which is the final 3.5.5 version)](https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/ppa/+sourcepub/2567714/+listing-archive-extra)
has been updated to the
[LibreOffice PPA](https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/ppa?field.series_filter=precise).
