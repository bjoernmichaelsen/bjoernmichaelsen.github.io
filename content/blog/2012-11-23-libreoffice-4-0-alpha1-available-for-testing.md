LibreOffice 4.0 alpha1 available for testing 
=============================================

<p style="text-align:right;"><em>…the Linux philosophy is "laugh in the face of danger". Oops. Wrong one.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><em>-- <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?&amp;selm=Pine.LNX.3.91.961016155929.27735D-100000%40linux.cs.Helsinki.FI">Linus Torvalds</a></em></p>
LibreOffice 4.0 alpha1 has been <a href="https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/gitweb?p=core.git;a=commit;h=dec8fe97d9f48d59b6bb0f98faded0f6aa8397df">silently tagged in the LibreOffice repositories three days ago</a>. Yesterday, I uploaded a build of it for Ubuntu Quantal to the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/libreoffice-prereleases/+packages">libreoffice-prereleases PPA</a>. Its a pre-release, an alpha -- essentially just a named daily build -- and will kill your dog and eat your children. Also, it will not cleanly install yet without removing your old version of LibreOffice first. But it has lots of nasty new features and tasty new bugs. So if you are a bug hunter and want to help to make the version of LibreOffice in Ubuntu Raring the best ever, this is your chance to test and tease this version and get it the most polished one ever in a Ubuntu release. Happy testing and bug reporting!

P.S.: At just three weeks after the UDS this is likely the earliest date of making available the upcoming LibreOffice version for the upcoming Ubuntu release. I am looking forward for this to pay off in less bugs even more stability of LibreOffice upon Ubuntu release.
