How to survive being bought by Oracle?
======================================

When I wrote [Quo vadis with The Document
Foundation?](https://bjoernmichaelsen.github.io/blog/tdf-okrs/) a month ago,
that was mostly a side product of sorting out my thoughts on open source
governance in general, and on LibreOffice in particular. And while that sparked
some discussion on the identity of the LibreOffice project, mostly [here on
Board
Discuss](https://community.documentfoundation.org/t/ideas-around-tdfs-future/11436/88),
it ultimately was preparation for a talk Thorsten and me had submitted for a
vacation on [Chaos Communication Camp
2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Camp). Our preparation
was somewhat _chaotic_ -- because both Thorsten and me decided to get very
creative about the "dont come by car" suggestion by the organizers and our talk
being scheduled on the first day of the event -- so we ended up honouring the
LibreOffice tradition of finishing slides only hours before the scheduled slot.

The session itself did not seem to have suffered too much by this -- it was
more free form, which might actually have been a bonus. We ended up even being
allowed to use some extra time for Q&A as there was quite some interest for
that in the audience.

The video recording can be found on
[media.ccc.de](https://media.ccc.de/v/camp2023-57278-how_to_survive_being_sold_to_oracle)
and describes both bits of the history of the LibreOffice fork a decade ago and
lessons learned that are still relevant for open source communities forking (or
otherwise reorganizing themselves) today.

A huge thank you to all the volunteers that made #CCCamp23 (and therefore this
talk) happen, especially [c3voc](https://chaos.social/@c3voc) for the recording
and [c3cert](https://chaos.social/@c3cert) who did a great job in checking a
minor injury I suffered due to my own stupidity during the event.
